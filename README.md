## Submission for CPP-Course
I did a three lane system that will spawn obstacles that move towards the player. The player will be able to move letf or right to avoid the oncoming obstacles. The AI opponent are using a Raycast to detect wheter a obstacle are approaching in front of it and if it detecs a obstacle it moves to a empty lane in order to avoid it. The ObstacleSpawner is an actor in charge of handling the spawning of the obstacles. The score is determined over the time the player is still alive which will be put on the leaderboard if the player reaches a highscore.
## Part 2
I implementet a feature that has a small chance to destroy the next oncoming obstacle as a reward for dodging it.
